    "Introduction\n",
    "----------\n",
    "[Python](http://www.python.org) is a high level language that is object-oriented, dynamic with strong typing, and interpreted and interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "Python has a clear and concise syntax, which favors the readability of source code, and makes the language more productive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The language includes several high-level structures (lists, dictionaries, date / time, complex numbers and others) and a vast collection of modules ready for use, plus third-party frameworks that can be added. Python supports modular, functional, and object-oriented programming. Even the basic types in Python are objects. The language is interpreted through bytecode by the Python virtual machine, making the code portable. This makes it possible to build applications on one platform and run them on other systems or directly from the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is open source software. The language specification is maintained by the [Python Software Foundation](http://www.python.org/psf/) (PSF). It is possible to integrate Python with other languages such as C and Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "History\n",
    "---------\n",
    "The language was created in 1990 by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands (CWI) and had originally focused on users as physicists and engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the language is well accepted in the industry for high-tech companies, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Google (Web applications).\n",
    "+ Yahoo (Web applications).\n",
    "+ Microsoft (IronPython: Python for. NET)\n",
    "+ Nokia (available for recent lines of cell phones and PDAs).\n",
    "+ Disney (3D animations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also widely used in biomedical informatics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Versions\n",
    "-------\n",
    "The official implementation of Python is maintained by the PSF and written in C, and therefore is also known as CPython. The latest stable version is available for download at:\n",
    "\n",
    "[http://www.python.org/download/](http://www.python.org/download/)\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows platforms, simply run the installer. On Linux and MacOS, Python is usually already part of the system, but in some cases it may be necessary to compile and install the interpreter from the source files.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also implementations of Python for. NET (IronPython), JVM (Jython) and Python (PyPy).\n",
    "\n",

    "In the example, `instruments` is a list containing the items \"Bass\", \"Drums\" and \"Guitar\". Now `instrument` is a name that corresponds to each of the items on the list, as the loop is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python source files have the extension \".py\" and can be run directly by the interpreter:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python apl.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "This runs `apl.py`. On Windows, the file extensions \".py\", \".pyw\", \".pyc\" and \".pyo\" are associated with Python automatically during installation, so clicking such a file will run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Typing\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "Python uses dynamic typing, which means that the type of a variable is inferred by the interpreter at runtime (this is known as *Duck Typing*). By the time a variable is created by the interpreter its type is determined. Each type supports a defined set of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compilation and interpretation\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "Python source code is translated by Python into bytecode, a binary format which is written in the interpreter's instruction set. The bytecode is cross-platform and can be distributed and run without the original source.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Compilation, interpretation and packing](files/bpyfd_diags1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the parser compiles the code and stores the bytecode on disk, so future executions of the program do not need to recompile its source. This reduces the load time of execution. If source files change, the interpreter will regenerate the bytecode automatically, even when the programmer is using the *interactive shell*. When a program or a module is invoked, the interpreter analyzes the code, converts it to symbols, compiles it if a current bytecode file does not exist, and runs it in the Python virtual machine. Bytecode files have the extension \".pyc\" (normal bytecode) or \".pyo\" (optimized bytecode).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive Mode\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "The Python interpreter can be used interactively. A programmer can type code at a *prompt* (command line) *shell* similar to the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "`python`\n",
    "\n",
    "It is ready to receive commands after the appearance of the signal `>>>` on the screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Python 2.6.4 (r264:75706, Nov  3 2009, 13:20:47)`<br/>\n",
    "`[GCC 4.4.1] on linux2`<br/>\n",
    "`Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.`<br/>\n",
    "`>>>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive mode makes it easy to test and modify code snippets before inclusion in programs, to extract and convert data or even analyze the state of the objects in memory, among other possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "There are many development tools for Python, such as *Integrated Development Environments* (IDEs), editors and shells (that take advantage of the interactive capabilities of Python). Pick one you like and learn to use its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also text editors specialized in programming code, which have features like syntax colorization, export to other formats and convert text encoding. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Frameworks* are collections of software components (libraries, utilities and others) that have been designed to be used by other systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the best known *frameworks* availble are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Web: Django, TurboGears, Zope and web2py.\n",
    "+ Graphic interface: wxPython, PyGTK and PyQt.\n",
    "+ Scientific processing: NumPy and SciPy.\n",
    "+ Image processing: PIL.\n",
    "+ 2D: Matplotlib and SVGFig.\n",
    "+ Object-relational mapping: SQLAlchemy and SQLObject.\n",
    "\n",
    "Culture\n",
    "-------\n",
    "The name Python was taken by Guido van Rossum from british TV program *Monty Python's Flying Circus*, and there are many references to the show in its documentation. For instance, Python's oficial package repository was called Cheese Shop, the name of one of the frames of the program. Currently, the repository name is [Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi) (PYPI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Proposals for improving the language are called [Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/), which also serve as a reference for new features to be implemented in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the official website, another good source of information about the language is the [Python Cookbook](http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/Cookbook/), a site that stores \"recipes\": small portions of code to accomplish specific tasks."
